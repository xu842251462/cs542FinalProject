In this project, we need lib in rquirement.txt, there are two .ipnyb files: preprocessingData.ipynb, randomForestPrediction.ipynb. 
There is data file for storing the csv file and pickle file(training data and testing data)
We use python version: 3.8
After installing the lib in requirment, we can directly run the two .ipnyb files.
