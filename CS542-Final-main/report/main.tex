\title{Using random forest regression to determine what factors have influence on life expectancy}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  By using the Life Expectancy dataset provided by Kaggle, we wanted to see what the world needed to improve on the Life Expectancy. We used a random forest regressor to determine the effects of scaling certain features and their correlation to Life Expectancy.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The dataset contains different countries with different life expectancy. Some variables have a very weak relationship with life expectancy or even cannot affect life expectancy. The life expectancy Report is a survey of the state of global life expectancy, reporting these 18 factors: Country, Year, Status, Life expectancy, Adult Mortality, infant deaths, Alcohol, percentage expenditure, Hepatitis B, Measles, BMI, under-five deaths, Polio, Total expenditure, Diphtheria, HIV/AIDS, GDP, Population, thinness 1-19 years, thinness 5-9 years, Income composition of resources, Schooling. In the project, we need to discover which factor has more influence on life expectancy.  All code, reports and supplementing information can be located at \url{https://github.com/xu842251462/cs542FinalProject}


\section{Background}
Life expectancy is a worldwide topic. It is meaningful to discover which factor in real life will impact our life expectancy. Data we get is from people in over 150 countries. Features in the dataset will be filtered because we want to find the most important feature works on the life expectancy.

\section{Dataset preparation}
\subsection{Data overview}
There are currently 150 countries and regions included within. The first element records the name of the country, the second element indicates the year of the data. In our project, we will drop the status column from the data. Our Y value is "Life Expectancy".
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{1.jpg}
    \caption{figure 1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data processing}
We use dict in the python to store the data from csv, which is shown at figure 2. 
Later we will find the exception through dict. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{2.jpg}
    \caption{figure 2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generate training and testing data and delete the exception from the dataset}
We extract 80 percent of data as our training data and the remaining 20 percent as our testing data. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{3.jpg}
    \caption{figure 3}
\end{figure}
We delete the exception from the data set. After we go through the dataset, we find there are two countries with 1 row. We drop it.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{4.jpg}
    \caption{figure 4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Normalizing the data}
Using minmaxscaler to normalize the testing data and training data, then we can convert the data to a pickle file.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{5.jpg}
    \caption{figure 5}
\end{figure}


\section{Experimentation}
\subsection{overview}
We plan to find the optimal value from the decision tree. Using a random forest regressor to decide which factor will have a bigger influence on life expectancy. 
\subsection{Algorithm decision}
When we figure out which algorithms will be used in our project. We rule out some other different algorithms. For example, linear regression, SVM and so on. Based on our dataset, we choose to use random regression to predict the factor which has a big influence on our life expectancy. From the dataset, the highest level of life expectancy does not show that a high life expectancy is equally as high compared to countries with less. After we rule out other possible algorithms, the data leads us to the random forest. 
\subsection{Implementation}
We set the coverage for the algorithm, add the trees amount and increase the possible nodes per tree. We observe the incremental changes on the tree and improvement decreases. Through the binary tree, we need to check the nodes with different features, then we can figure out the progress of prediction for each feature which impacts the life expectancy.  

\section{Results}
\subsection{Set Baseline}
Before we can make and evaluate predictions, we need to set up the baseline. In this way, we can measure if our model can beat after training. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{6.png}
    \caption{figure 6}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Train model}
Using scikit learn, instantiate the model. We import the random first regression model, and use training data.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{7.png}
    \caption{figure 7}
\end{figure}

\subsection{make prediction on the test set and determine the performance}
We have got the relationships between the feature and target. Then we need to figure out if our result is good enough. In order to make predictions, we need to use the absolute error. We compare the predictions to the known answer. We want to know how far the prediction value is from the actual value. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{8.png}
    \caption{figure 8}
\end{figure}
From the above figure, we get the 0.03 degree, which is much better than the baseline error. Also, we get  89.89% accuracy. We will try to improve this accuracy later.

\subsection{variable importance}
In order to quantify the usefulness of all the variables from the testing data, we want to find the relative importances of variables. The code we use the zip, osring and argument unpacking. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{9.png}
    \caption{figure 9}
\end{figure}
We can get the index 17, 12 , 1â€¦ are most relative variables in our testing data. Then we calculate importance twice, we pick the most important column from testing data. We calculate the importance again. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{10.png}
    \caption{figure 10}
\end{figure}
After we get the updated importance, we can figure which index will be more important. 
We also test the mean absolute and accuracy again. We hope after training  the most relative variable, the error and accuracy can further improve.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{11.png}
    \caption{figure 11}
\end{figure}
From the above data we get, the error is improved. The accuracy is infinitely closed to the 100 percent


\section{Math Background}
We need to measure the performance of the model, In order to calculate the loss, using below formula: 

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{n} \frac{abs(predict_{n} - truth_{n})}{truth_{n}}$$

We get the predicted value from regress.predict(), then calculate the percentage to the loss. Adding up all dimension test data through the formula above will help me to get a loss percentage later. Another method we used to test for errors is to calculate the mean square error of the random forest regressor model. For calculate the MSE, we use following formula: 
$$ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{\Big(\frac{d_i -f_i}{\sigma_i}\Big)^2}}$$

\section{Limitations}

For the dataset, we drop the status of the country and year column. If we want to use status and year, we may consider other methods to predict life expectancy. More comprehensive feature works for the real life situation.

\section{Additional work}
In future implementations of the model, we can remove the variables that have no importance. The performance will not suffer. If we use a differing model, like a support vector machine, we can use the random forest feature importance as a feature selection method.

\begin{comment}


\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2021+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2021}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.

\begin{ack}
Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.

Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
\end{ack}

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
when listing the references.
Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.
